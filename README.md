# Liquibase Introduction
Liquibase is a database schema change management solution that enables you to revise and release database changes faster and safer from development to production.

To keep it simple, you can write migrations in SQL â€” a database-specific syntax supported for PL/SQL. To take advantage of abstraction abilities, use a database-agnostic way by specifying your changes in XML, JSON, or YAML.

# Liquibase Integration
* Create a Mule project.
* Create a databasechange log file and scripts file.
* Create liquibase properties for database credentials. 
* Add liquibase dependencies in pom.xml
* Run maven liuibase update command.
